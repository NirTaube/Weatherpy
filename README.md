# WeatherPy & VacationPy

WeatherPy and VacationPy are two related projects that analyze weather data across the world's cities and help users plan their vacations based on specific weather conditions.

## WeatherPy

### Overview
WeatherPy is a Python script that visualizes the weather of 500+ cities across the world at varying distances from the equator. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather information and leverages Pandas, Matplotlib, and other libraries to create scatter plots that showcase relationships between weather variables such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

### Features
- Collects data from the OpenWeatherMap API for over 500 cities.
- Creates scatter plots to analyze the relationship between various weather attributes.
- Determines the correlation between latitude and weather phenomena.
- Saves both the data and the scatter plots for further analysis.
